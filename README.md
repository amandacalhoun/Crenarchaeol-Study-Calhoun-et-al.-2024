Hello! Happy you're here. 

I have included one main file of R code that utilizes both the datasets "allData" and "yellowstone_data" 
for plots and statistical analyses related to the Calhoun et al., 2024 paper on crenarchaeol abundances in 
terrestrial hydrothermal springs. 

Sections should be clearly delineated and are supposed to organize sections of similar code. 
The plot section comes before the stats section.

To run the full suite of correlation tests and linear models in the paper, you'll have to change 
the variables that are included in the lines of code that run these in the "STATISTICS" section.

For your purposes, it may be useful to combine cren and cren' values or CL and IPL values from the yellowstone dataset.

Please don't hesitate to reach out to amandacalhoun15@gmail.com with any questions.
